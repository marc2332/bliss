    TDD
    Test Driven Development
        a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very
        short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test
        cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This
        is opposed to software development that allows software to be added
        that isn't proven to meet requirements.
