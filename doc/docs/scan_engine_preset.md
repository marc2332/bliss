*Presets* are used to set environnement for a scan. Typically to control:

* opening/closing of a shutter
* detector cover removing/replacing
* [multiplexer](config_opiom.md#multiplexer)
* pause during a scan
* equipment protection (via data channels hook, see below)
* ...

A preset is a *hook* in a scan iteration. This hook can be set at different
levels depending on the need.

* to hook a whole scan, it will inherit from `ScanPreset`
* to hook a part of the acquisition chain it will inherit from `ChainPreset`

## ScanPreset
This is the simplest one. This one has 3 callback methods:

* `prepare()`: called before all devices preparation
* `start()`: called before all devices starting
* `stop()`: called after all devices are stopped


Example of custom scan preset:
```python
from bliss.scanning.scan import ScanPreset
class Preset(ScanPreset):
    def prepare(self,scan):
        print(f"Preparing scan {scan.name}\n")
    def start(self,scan):
        print(f"Starting scan {scan.name}")
        print(f"Opening the shutter")
    def stop(self,scan):
        print(f"{scan.name} scan is stopped")
        print(f"Closing the shutter")
```
```python
DEMO [3]: p = Preset()
DEMO [4]: s = loopscan(2,0.1,diode,run=False)
DEMO [5]: s.add_preset(p)
DEMO [6]: s.run()

           0             0      -40.2222

Took 0:00:09.830967

Closing the shutter
```

###Â Data channels hook

The `ScanPreset` has a `connect_data_channels` method, to execute a callback
when data is emitted from channels.

It is useful in order to protect some equipments, for example: if the value
measured by a diode exceeds some threshold, the scan can stop or some
attenuators can be activated.

The basic usage is to call the `.connect_data_channels()` method, from the
`.prepare()` of `ScanPreset`. Arguments are:

* the list of counters to connect data channels to
* a callback function

Example:

```python
class MyScanPreset(ScanPreset):
   def __init__(self, diode):
       super().__init__()

       self.diode = diode


   def prepare(self, scan):
       self.connect_data_channels([self.diode, ...], self.protect_my_detector)


   def protect_my_detector(self, counter, channel_name, data):
       if counter == diode:
           # assuming the counter has only 1 channel, no need to
           # check for channel name
           if data > threshold:
               # protect the detector...

```

If an exception is raised in the callback function, the scan will stop.


## ChainPreset

This hook is linked to a *top-master* of the acquisition chain. So the
callback method will be called during `prepare`, `start` and `stop`
phases of this top-master. It has exactly the same behaviour than
the `ScanPreset` if the chain has **only one** top-master.

i.e: In a loopscan, the sole top master is a timer, so here is the same simple
example where the need is to open a shutter at the beginning of the scan and to
close it at the end.

```python
from bliss.scanning.chain import ChainPreset
class Preset(ChainPreset):
    def prepare(self,acq_chain):
        print("Preparing")
    def start(self,acq_chain):
        print("Starting, Opening the shutter")
    def stop(self,acq_chain):
        print("Stopped, closing the shutter")
```
```python
DEMO [1]: s = loopscan(2, 0.1, diode, run=False)
DEMO [1]: p = Preset()
DEMO [1]: s.acq_chain.add_preset(p)
DEMO [1]: s.run()

Scan 13 Wed Mar 13 11:54:08 2019 /tmp/scans/demo/data.h5 demo user = seb
loopscan 2 0.1

           #         dt[s]         diode
Preparing
Starting, Opening the shutter
           0             0       24.1111
           1      0.105099       1.22222
Stopped, closing the shutter

Took 0:00:36.189189
```

## ChainIterationPreset

Use this object when you want to set a hook on each *iteration* of a
top-master. `ChainIterationPreset` is **yield** from `ChainPreset`
instance by *get_iterator* method. i.e here is an example where you want to
open/close the shutter for each point.

```python
class Preset(ChainPreset):
    class Iterator(ChainIterationPreset):
        def __init__(self,iteration_nb):
            self.iteration = iteration_nb
        def prepare(self):
            print(f"Preparing iteration {self.iteration}")
        def start(self):
            print(f"Starting, Opening the shutter iter {self.iteration}")
        def stop(self):
            print(f"Stopped, closing the shutter, iter {self.iteration}")
    def get_iterator(self,acq_chain):
        iteration_nb = 0
        while True:
            yield Preset.Iterator(iteration_nb)
            iteration_nb += 1
```
```python
DEMO [2]: p = Preset()
DEMO [3]: s = loopscan(2,0.1,diode,run=False)
DEMO [4]: s.acq_chain.add_preset(p)
DEMO [5]: s.run()

Scan 18 Wed Mar 13 14:15:40 2019 /tmp/scans/demo/data.h5 demo user = seb
loopscan 2 0.1

           #         dt[s]         diode
Preparing iteration 0
Starting, Opening the shutter iter 0
Stopped, closing the shutter, iter 0
Preparing iteration 1
Starting, Opening the shutter iter 1
           0             0       22.4444
           1       0.10728       13.5556
Stopped, closing the shutter, iter 1

```

!!! warning
    In this example, you can see that *data display* and the *chain
    iteration* are executed by two separated greenlets which are not
    synchronised. This is not a problem but can be confusing if you think
    that it's sequencial.

## To pause a scan

As `Preset` callbacks are executed synchronously, they can easily pause
a scan, just by not returning imediatly from *prepare*, *start* or *stop*
callback methods.

For example, to pause a scan in case of beam loss, the condition has to be
checked in a loop.

As an example, wait to start a scan if the beam is not present.
```python
class Preset(ScanPreset):
    def __init__(self,diode,beam_trigger_value):
        self._diode = diode
        self._beam_trigger_value

    def prepare(self,scan):
        beam_value = self._diode.read()
        while beam_value < self._beam_trigger_value:
            print("Waiting for beam")
            print(f"read {beam_value} expect {self._beam_trigger_value}",end='\r')
            gevent.sleep(1)
            beam_value = self._diode.read()
```
