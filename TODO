TODO list
---------


* unittest improvement:
    => replace all position tests by assertAlmostEquals()
    => if possible use the decimal places according to motor step_per_unit

* slits calculation controller:
    => have only a pair of blades instead of two

* calculation controller:
    => bliss ask motion on all virtual calculated motors of the same
       calculation controller (cf avoid slit drift)

* bliss alarm mechanism:
    => discrepancy between measured and target position
    => to be define

* acceleration
    (all the discussion Manu had with EP)
    => in controllers, set_acceleration/get_acceleration
    => in axis, acceleration([new_acceleration])
    => set_acceleration_mode: acctime or time/sec-2
    => "get_acceleration_steps": returns the encoder/motor acceleration ramp in "steps" (or "units" ?)

* Tango
    => clean all Steps* attributes
    => Steps_per_unit, Backlash, Home_position: should it be in config xml instead of being memorized ?
    => remove "memorized" flag on attributes and test Bliss settings
    => add Group device

* limits
    => make sure motion stops with an error when hitting a hard limit

* settings
    => saving of settings : when ?
    => saving : more readable ?

* continue documentation
