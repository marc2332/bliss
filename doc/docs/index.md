BLISS stands for BeamLine Instrumentation Support Software.

The BLISS project started in December, 2015 inside the
Beamline Control Unit (BCU, Software Group), and comes within
the scope of the ESRF Extremely Brilliant Source upgrade
program (ESRF-EBS).

The BLISS control system provides a global approach to run synchrotron
experiments requiring to synchronously control motors, detectors and
various acquisition devices thanks to hardware integration, Python
sequences and an advanced scanning engine.

As a Python package, BLISS can be easily embedded into any Python
application. BLISS data management features enable custom scripts
to perform online data analysis.

In addition, BLISS ships with tools to enhance scientists' user
experience:

* a web portal to get access to BLISS applications
* a centralized logs viewer
* a configuration application
* a powerful command line interface
* an online data visualisation application
