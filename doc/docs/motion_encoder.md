# Encoder

An encoder (`bliss.common.encoder.Encoder` object) can be defined on its own, or
can be associated to an axis to check position reached after a movement.

* For configuration, see: [Encoder Configuration](config_encoder.md)
* For specific details about icepap encoders, see
[Icepap Encoder Configuration](config_icepap.md#encoder-configuration)

!!! note
    There are 2 `tolerance` parameters in configuration: one for
    `Axis` and the other one for `Encoder`.

If an encoder is associated to an axis:

* the method `.measured_position()` uses `encoder.read()` to calculate
  the value returned *in user units*.
* if `check_encoder` is set to `True` in config, *after* a
  movement, the encoder position is read and compared to the target
  position of the movement. In case of difference outside the limit
  fixed by **Encoder tolerance**, an exception is raised with message:
  `"didn't reach final position"`
* and if `read_position` is set to `encoder` in *configuration*, the
hardware position return by the axis is the position read by the
encoder like `.measured_position()`. This option disable the
**discrepancy check** at the beginning of a movement unless
`check_encoder` is also set to `True`.

!!! note
    This `measured_position()` method is used in particular by
    TangoDS and can be easily compared to the target position with
    atk-moni for tuning purposes.

* `dial_measured_position()` returns the dial encoder position *in
  user units*.


An encoder can be used to define events to trig on special positions.

## Encoder as a counter

It is possible to use an encoder alone to read it or to scan/count it.

```python
DEMO [9]: samy.encoder
 Out [9]: ENCODER:
               tolerance (to check pos at end of move): 0.001
               dial_measured_position:    7.39992
```

```python
DEMO [13]:
DEMO [13]: ct(1, samy.encoder)
Fri Feb 07 11:53:15 2020

position = 7.399929 ( 7.399929 /s)
  Out [13]: Scan(number=4, name=ct, path=)
```
