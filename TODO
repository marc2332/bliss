* acceleration
    (all the discussion Manu had with EP)
    => in controllers, set_acceleration/get_acceleration
    => in axis, acceleration([new_acceleration])
    => set_acceleration_mode: acctime or time/sec-2
    => "get_acceleration_steps": returns the encoder/motor acceleration ramp in "steps" (or "units" ?)

* Tango
    => clean all Steps* attributes
    => Steps_per_unit, Backlash, Home_position: should it be in config xml instead of being memorized ?

    => add Group device

* limits
    => make sure motion stops with an error when hitting a hard limit

* settings
