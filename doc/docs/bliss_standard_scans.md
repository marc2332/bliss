# Standard scans

Bliss provides a wide choice of standard scans for step by step scanning
procedures.

### Running a scan

#### Start a scan (with data saving):
```python

ascan( axis, start, stop, steps, count_time, cnt1, ..., MG1, ..., ctrl1, ...)

```

The scans accept as arguments a mix of `MeasurementGroups`, `Controllers` and
`Counters`. If not provided, the default measurement group is used.

#### Create then start (with data saving):
```python
s = ascan( axis, start, stop, steps, count_time, cnt1,  run=False)
s.run()
```

#### Scan without data saving
```python
ascan( axis, start, stop, steps, count_time, cnt1, save=False)
```

!!!note:
    By default, for all standard scans `run=True` and `save=True` except for the
    `ct()` scan which uses `save=False`.  If `save=False`, the data is generated
    but not saved to file.


#### Examples

* Scan with one axis and the default measurement (with data saving)
```python
ascan( roby, 0, 10, 10, 0.1)
```

* Scan with a given measurement group (without data saving)
```python
ascan( roby, 0, 10, 10, 0.1, MG2, save=False)
```

* Scan with all counters of a counter controller
```python
ascan( roby, 0, 10, 10, 0.1, lima1)
```

* Scan with a measurement group + all counters of a counter controller + 2 other
  counters

```python
ascan( roby, 0, 10, 10, 0.1, MG1, lima1, diode4, diode5)
```


#### Scanning and monitoring data

The data produced by a scan are printed in a separated window which can be
display by pressing `F5`.

```python
Scan 28 Wed Feb 19 14:29:51 2020  test_session user = pguillou
ascan roby 0 10 10 0.1

 #       dt[s]   roby     diode    diode2    diode3   diode5

#### Scanning, acquisition chain and data production

During the scan creation, all the counters that are passed are introspected in
order to build the acquisition chain.

The acquisition chain is a tree that reflects the hierarchy between the
different involved objects.

The root of the tree is the top master. The top master will produce the triggers
and propagate them along the branches of the tree. Each node of tree which has
associated counters will start acquiring the data in parallel of the others
while receiving the trigger from its parent node.

```python
IN  [65]: s=ascan(roby,0,10,10,0.1,MG1,diode5, save=False)
IN  [66]: print(s.acq_chain._tree)
acquisition chain
└── axis
    └── timer
        ├── simulation_diode_sampling_controller
        ├── simulation_diode_sampling_controller
        └── simulation_diode_sampling_controller
```
