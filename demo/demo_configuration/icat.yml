# in the objects section a mapping between entire bliss
# objects that produce nexus/icat compliant metadata
# and icat objects can be done. The keys in the following
# mapping are the keys of bliss.icat.instrument.INSTRUMENTATION

objects:
  secondary_slit: $secondary_slits

# as icat defines its own sub groups of positioners there
# is a dedicated section here. Keys in there are icat 
positioners:
  sample: [$sy,$sz]

# in the mapping section individual keys can be mapped to 
# icat keys under mapping musst be valid icat field names
mapping:
  InstrumentVariables_name: [ $sy.name, $sz.name ]
  InstrumentVariables_value: [ $sy.position, $sz.position ]
  # by the way, this is just a demo ... this mapping
  # does probably not make sense...
